  <p class="margin-400">
         I once found a mod for minecraft that enabled me to make custom animations for minecraft. One would load up a custom rig in blender and animate it (fully forward kinematics, no special IK or constraints) then export it to the mod's custom format. I had made one animation and tested it on a survial minecraft world I was playing on, and recorded it working. I happened to post the video on the Mod developers' discord, where another dev of a server mod approached me to work on more emotes for him. This mod was some kind of server-side shop that uses the animation mod as basis for the purchasable emotes. I'm almost certain this was against Minecraft's EULA but that wasn't my problem. I ended up making hundreds of emotes for the team and below is just a select few favorites. <br> Later on they provided me with a modified rig that had more bones for props and the ability to add props to the animation. however it was an EXTREMELY limited amount of bones, only 3 to start with. I eventually made them a better rig with even more bones, but I have no idea if they ever used it.

  <p>Moon Walk: This was the original animation that got me the job. I was doing this in a modpack that included the ability to travel to the moon, and ofcourse I had to make a Michael Jackson moon walk on the moon.</p>

  <p>Boxtrot: A receation of TF2's taunt for the spy. They gave me alot of freedom to suggest emote ideas and this was one of them. This was before I was provided a rig with prop bones, so the Box is locked to the head, as a result the player never reveals his face sadly. You'll notice from here on out, all emotes are blender renders, because they never provided me the mods for the prop rendering.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Keyboard Warrior: Requested by them. I'm very proud of the animation on this one, the flow, follow thru, and anticipation was something I was really proud of in the movement of the animation. and the movement of the arms together making you think the keyboard is one, when it was always 2 pieces. I modeled the Keyboard. Notice the text callouts to add smoke particles as that was apparently what they would do on their end. along with the Keyboard keys flying off the board as a particle too, which I also modeled.</p>

  <p>PianoMan: A simple Piano playing emote, I'm showcasing this as a model showcase, although its so close up you can't see all that much of the piano, but I'm quite proud of my minecraft style design. </p>

  </div>
  <p>TV Shows: This was a quite ambitious one. As I said previously the rig only had a few bones at the time, so every moving object in this scene had its own bone. I couldn't use animated textures, I couldn't use shapekeys, I couldn't use separate rigs, it was all in one rig with 7 dummy bones. notice some 2D objects are even sharing the same bone, like the chicken, flipping around to show the meat when the chef chops it. and static image being the same texture just rotating. Both the chef and salesman characters are refrences to my old minecraft youtube videos.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Making it rain: This was when I was given a slightly better rig and they were asking the impossible of me. For whatever reason they demanded that I hand animate the falling dollars instead of using particles on their end. they wanted large bursts of dollars everywhere but I had to convince them to either install a better rig or use less dollars. This thing took 7 attempts till they were happy. and animating every single dollar, no physics, no constraints, and having to loop perfectly, was frankly not worth the money. </p>

  </div>
  <p>Kazostky Kick: Lastly another simple TF2 taunt recreation, something I wanted them to add since starting to work for them, but had to wait a long time till they accepted, it was quite an expressive bouncy emote to exit the project on.</p>

    <p>The Limited Rig I started off with. with only 3 dummy prop bones. eventually I made one with 7</p>

    <p>After that, I made them the ultimate rig with 15 dummy bones, and 3 subrig bones for characters, or moving props with multiple joints. suffice to say, I don't think it was ever used.</p>
